# Neudesic GitHub Profile

The `.github` repository is a special repository and is used to provide the profile content for the `neudesic` GitHub organization page hosted at https://github.com/neudesic. The Neudesic profile is intended to:

* welcome visitors to the Neudesic GitHub organization
* provide links to the Neudesic website
* direct job seekers to the Neudesic Careers website
* help Neudesic employees get started with working on Innersource projects in GitHub Enterprise

## Change the Profile Content

Maintaining the Neudesic profile on GitHub is a community endeavor. We welcome updates to keep the content current and improvements to make the profile look better. To contribute improvements or fresh content into the profile, please follow these steps:

1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/neudesic/.github/issues) to describe the type of change that you want to make and why. The organization administrators will review your issue and may provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas to help you make the change.
2. Fork the `neudesic/.github` repository.
3. Create a new branch and make your changes on the branch.
4. When your new content or improvements are ready, create a pull request asking that your new content or improvements be incorporated into the profile and published to the `neudesic` organization on GitHub.
5. The organization administrators will review your changes and improvements. You may be asked through comments on the pull request to make additional changes to your content.
6. When the pull request has been approved, the pull request branch will be merged into the `main` branch and your changes will become public.

Thank you for taking the time to keep the Neudesic GitHub community growing and thriving!
